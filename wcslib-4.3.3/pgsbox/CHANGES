PGSBOX version 4.3 (2007/12/27)
-------------------------------

* Miscellaneous improvements to PGSBOX.

* Do Fortran name mangling using using an autoconf-defined macro.

* General improvements to the makefile for portability, including not relying
  on "." being in the PATH when running tests.

* Switched licensing to LGPL 3.0.


PGSBOX version 4.2 (2005/09/23)
-------------------------------

* No substantive changes were made; the version number was incremented solely
  to keep it in sync with WCSLIB.


PGSBOX version 4.1 (2005/08/31)
-------------------------------

* Fixed a subtle though benign memory fault identified by 'purify'.

* Reset LATPOLE in the COE example in cpgtest.f when drawing the second
  (native) grid because it will have been set to a non-default value by
  wcsset() when the first grid was drawn; set wcs.flag to -1 before wcsinit()
  and call wcsfree() at the end.  Similarly for pgtest.f.


PGSBOX version 4.0 (2005/02/07)
-------------------------------

* Changed the copyright notice in all library routines from LGPL to GPL as
  recommended by the FSF (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html).

* Added an "install" target to the Makefile.


PGSBOX version 3.6 (2004/08/25)
-------------------------------

* Further generalization of the Makefile, with numerous minor fixes.


PGSBOX version 3.5 (2004/06/28)
-------------------------------

* In PGSBOX, increased the dimension of the WORLD and XY vectors from 2 to 9
  to accomodate higher-dimensional coordinate representations of up to 9
  elements.  Similarly for pgwcsl().  The assumption (presently) is that the
  first two world, and pixel, coordinate elements are the relevant ones; the
  others are all set to zero when pgwcsl() initializes and otherwise ignored.

  Assigned some variables in DATA to stop compiler messages about
  uninitialized variables.

* Generalized the Makefile, bringing it into line with the WCSLIB Makefile,
  and adding separate targets for compiling and running the test programs.
  The default target now simply compiles pgsbox.c and cpgsbox.c.  A separate
  target compiles pgwcsl.c and inserts it into ../C/libwcs.a.


PGSBOX version 3.4 (2004/02/11)
-------------------------------

* No substantive changes were made; the version number was incremented solely
  to keep it in sync with WCSLIB.


PGSBOX version 3.3 (2003/10/21)
-------------------------------

* PGSBOX now recognizes status returns -1, -2, and -3 from NLFUNC for opcodes
  +2 and +1 which cause it to accept the returned (x,y) coordinates but not
  consider them as one end of a crossing segment for labelling world
  coordinate 1, 2, or both.

* PGSBOX now takes care not to lose vertical tick marks (and hence labels) at
  the left or right edge of the frame.  Likewise for horizontal tick marks at
  the top or bottom edge of the frame.

* Tightened up the test in PGSBOX for cycles in angle to catch the case where
  the coordinate value spans a full 360 degrees.

* PGSBOX will no longer accept frame crossings that are too oblique; floating
  point rounding errors may cause grid lines that should otherwise track along
  the frame to weave down it from side-to-side resulting in spurious crossing
  points.

* Fixed a bug in pgwcsl_() for processing simple linear coordinates.

* pgwcsl_() now returns error -2 if the latitude is outside -90 to +90 for
  opcodes +2 and +1.

* Amended the translation of status return codes from WCSLIB in pgwcsl_().

* Provided a header file for pgwcsl_() (mainly for C++ usage).

* Added extra test plots to PGTEST and cpgtest.

* Added extra functionality to the Makefile.


PGSBOX version 3.2 (2003/09/09)
-------------------------------

* Added an ENTRY point, PGLBOX, that provides a simplified interface to PGSBOX
  for linear axes without having to specify an NLFUNC or the associated
  parameters.


PGSBOX version 3.1 (2003/04/29)
-------------------------------

* Added a C wrapper function, cpgsbox(), and C test/demo program, cpgtest,
  that duplicates PGTEST and serves as a C coding template.

* Added calendar date axes.

* Sped up the max/min search - if only tickmarks are required there is no need
  to search the interior of the image.

* Return margin widths in CACHE(,NC).

* Fixed a buglet that caused ticks at the frame edges to be skipped.

* Return error 3 if CACHE overflows.

Support routines:

* Adapted PGWCSL for WCSLIB 3.x - it is now a C function (for interfacing to
  WCSLIB) with a FORTRAN-like interface (for PGSBOX).
