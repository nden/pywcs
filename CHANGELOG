Version 1.3a1
=============

Earlier versions of pywcs had two versions of every conversion method:

  X(...)      -- treats the origin of pixel coordinates at (0, 0)
  X_fits(...) -- treats the origin of pixel coordinates at (1, 1)

From version 1.3 onwards, there is only one method for each
conversion, with an 'origin' argument:

  - 0: places the origin at (0, 0), which is the C/Numpy convention.

  - 1: places the origin at (1, 1), which is the Fortran/FITS
    convention.
